# bubbles_screensaver
fixing the windows 10 bubbles screensaver by running a python script that handles timing

so basically windows 10 nerfed the og win 7 bubbles screensaver by requiring that the background is a solid color and the bubbles sit on TOP of that.  however if you run Bubbles.scr youll find that it actually works like the original with transparency, thus meaning that the code for adding the solid color is most likely in the code that calls the screensaver.  So, this is a short python script that you literally can put in your startup folder and it should work.  

The default timer is on 2 minutes but you can change that in the code its like super easy

long live the cute bubble screensaver!!1!
